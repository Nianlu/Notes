# C13. I/O, Applets, and Other Topics

## 1. I/O Basics

### 1.1 Streams

##### A stream is an abstraction that either produces or consumes information
- A stream is linked to a physical devices by the Java I/O system
- All streams behave in the same manner (even linking to different physical devices)
- input
    + disk file
    + keyboard
    + network socket
- output
    + console
    + disk file
    + network connection
- defined in java.io package

##### In addition to the stream-based I/O defined in java.io, buffer- and channel-based I/O defined in java.nio

### 1.2 Byte Streams and Character Streams

- *Byte streams* for handling input and output of bytes
    + e.g. reading or writing binary data
- *Charater streams* for handling input and output of characters
    + use Unicode -> can be internationalized
    + more efficient in some cases
    + added by Java 1.1
- at the lowest level, all I/O is still byte-oriented.

##### The Byte Stream Classes
- two abstract classes as the top of class hierarchies
    + InputStream
    + OutputStream
- each of them has several concrete subclasses that handle the differences among various devices

##### The Charater Stream Classes
- two abstract classes as the top of class hierarchies
    + Reader
    + Writer
- handle Unicode character streams
- several concrete subclasses of each of these

### 1.3 The Predefined Streams

- System (java.lang) contains three predefined stream variables (all public, static, and final)
    + in
        * default standard input - keyboard
        * is an object of type *InputStream*
    + out
        * default standard output - console
        * is an object of type *PrintStream*
    + err
        * default console
        * is an object of type *PrintStream*
- these are byte streams, even though are typically used with characters

## 2. Reading Console Input

the preferred method of reading console input is to use a character-oriented stream. -> easier to internationalize and maintain

- convert to a character-based stream
- > BufferedReader(Reader inputReader)
    + Reader is an abstract class
- > InputStreamReader(InputStream inputStream)
    + subclass of Reader
    + converts bytes to characters

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

### 2.1 Reading Charaters

to read a character from BufferedReader
> int read() throws IOException

```java
char c = (char) br.read(); // one character
```

### 2.2 Reading Strings

to read a string from the keyboard from BufferedReader class
> String readLine() throws IOException

## 3. Writing Console Output

> void write(int byteval)

- a low-level method implemented from OutputStream
- not often use this but print() and println()

## 4. The PrintWriter Class

- character-based class
- recommended for real-world programs other than debugging purposes or sample programs
- easier to internationalize (than System.out)
- > PrintWriter(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushingOn) // constructor
- supports print() and println() methods

## 5. Reading and Writing Files

- two of the most often-used stream classes
    + FileInputStream
        * > FileInputStream(Stream fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
        * read()
    + FileOutputStream
        * > FileOutputStream(Stream fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
        * write()

##### must close the file
- two ways
    1. explicitly call close()
        * > void close() throws IOException
    2. use the try-with-resources statement (added by JDK 7)

## 6. Automatically Closing a File

##### automatic resource management
based on try-with-resources statement
> try(resource-specification) { //.. 

- when the try block ends, the resource is automatically released.
- used only with resources that implement AutoCloseable interface (defined by java.lang)

> e.g.
> try (FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream("file1"));
>   FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("file1")) { // multiple resources

## 7. Applet Fundamentals

##### applets are small applications that are accessed on an Internet server, transported over the Internet, automatically installed, and run as part of a web document.
After an applet arrives on the client, it has limited access to resources so that it can produce a graphical user interface and run various computations without introducing the risk of viruses or breaching data integrity.

..more details in the book with a simple example..

## 8. The transient and volatile Modifiers

type modifiers for handling somewhat specialized situations.

- transient
    + on an instance variable, then its value need not persist when an object is stored
- volatile
    + the variable can be changed unexpectedly by other parts of program
    + e.g. in a multithreaded program

## 9. Using instanceof

to obtain run-time type information about an object
> objref instanceof type

- return true if
    + objref is of the specified type
    + or can be cast into the specified type
- otherwise, return false

## 10. Strictfp

use on a class, a method, or interface to ensure the floating-point calculations take place precisely

## 11. Native Methods

call a subroutine that is written in a language other than Java

..more details in the book with example..

## 12. Problems with Native Methods

- Potential security risk
- Loss of portability

## 13. Using assert

##### to create an assertion which is a condition that should be true during the execution of the program.
at run time, if the condition is true, no other action, if false, an AssertionError is thrown.

> assert condition;
> assert condition: expr;

- condition should be boolean
- expr should be string or a reasonable string conversion and is passed to exception constructor

### 13.1 Assertion Enabling and Disabling Options
use -da option for all or -ea for a package when executing code

## 14. Static Import

import the static members of a class or interface
> import static java.lang.Math.sqrt; // e.g.
> import static java.lang.Math.*; // e.g. import all static methods or fields

## 15. Invoking Overloaded Constructors Through this()

must be the first in the constructor to call another constructor

## 16. Compact API Profiles

JDK 8 feature that organizes subsets of the API library into *compact profiles*

- compact1
- compact2
- compact3

when an application does not require the full library
