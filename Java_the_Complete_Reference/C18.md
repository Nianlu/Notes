# C18 java.util Part 1: The Collections Framework

## 1. Collections Overview

##### The Java Collections Framework standardizes the way in which groups of objects are handled by the programs
- added by J2SE 1.2
    + prior to the Collection Framework, Java provided ad hoc classes such as Dictionary, Vector, Stack, and Properties

##### The Collection framework was designed to meet several goals
1. the framework had to be high-performance
2. the framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
3. extending and/or adapting a collection had to be easy
4. mechanisms were added that allow the integration of standard arrays into the Collections Framework

##### Algorithms operate on collections and are defined as static methods within the Collection class
provide a standard means of manipulating collections

##### Iterator interface
- offers a general-purpose, standardized way of accessing the elements within a collection, one at a time.
- provides a means of enumerating the contents of a collection
- JDK 8 adds another type of iterator called a spliterator
    + are iterators that provide support for parallel iteration

## 2. JDK 5 Changed the Collections Framework

### 2.1 Generics Fundamentally Changed the Collection Framework

### 2.2 Autoboxing Facilitates the Use of Primitive Types

### 2.3 The For-Each Style for Loop

## 3. The Collection Interfaces

### 3.1 The Collection Interface
- extends the Iterable interface
- methods: add, remove, contains, isEmpty...

### 3.2 The List Interface
- extends Collections
- declares the behavior of a collection that stores a sequence of elements
- methods: add(int, E), get, set, indexOf...

### 3.3 The Set Interface
- extends Collection
- specifies the behavior of a collection that does not allow duplicate elements
- methods: add(return false if duplicate)...

### 3.4 The SortedSet Interface
- extends Set
- declares the behavior of a set sorted in ascending order
- methods: first, last, subSet...

### 3.5 The NavigableSet Interface
- extends SortedSet
- declares the behavior of a collection that supports the retrieval of elements based on the closest match to a given value or values.

### 3.6 The Queue Interface
- extends Collection
- declares the behavior of a queue which is often a first-in, first-out list.
- methods: poll, remove, .. element, peek, .. offer...

### 3.7 The Deque Interface
- extends Queue
- declares the behavior of a double-ended queue
- methods: addFirst, addLast, offerFirst, offerLast, (as a stack) push, pop...

## 4. The Collection Classes

### 4.1 The ArrayList Class
- extends AbstractList
- implements List interface
- supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed

##### 1. Obtaining an Array from an ArrayList
- ```Object[] toArray()```
- ```<T> T[] toArray(T array[])```

### 4.2 The LinkedList Class
- extends AbstractSequentialList
- implements the List, Deque, and Queue interface
- provides a linked-list data structure

### 4.3 The HashSet Class
- extends AbstractSet
- implements the Set interface
- creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage
- does not guarantee the order of elements (use TreeSet if needed)

### 4.4 The LinkedHashSet Class
- extends HashSet
- maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, in the order in which they were inserted.

### 4.5 The TreeSet Class
- extends AbstractSet
- implements the NavigableSet interface
- creates a collection that uses a tree for storage. Objects are stored, ascending order.

### 4.6 The PriorityQueue Class
- extends AbstractQueue
- implements the Queue interface
- creates a queue that is prioritized based on the queue's comparator
- the default comparator will order the queue in ascending order (head - smallest value)

### 4.7 The ArrayDeque Class
- extends AbstractCollection
- implements the Deque interface
- creates a dynamic array and has no capacity restrictions

### 4.8 The EnumSet Class
- extends AbstractSet
- implements Set
- is specifically for use with elements of an enum type
- defines no constructors. it uses the factory methods to create objects.

## 5. Accessing a Collection via an Iterator
- *interator* is an object that implements either the Iterator or the ListIterator interface
- **Iterator** enables you to cycle through a collection, obtaining or removing elements
- **ListIterator** extends **Iterator** to allow bidirectional traversal of a list, and the modification of elements

### 5.1 Using an Iterator
1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling the collection's iterator() method
2. Set up a loop that makes a call to hasNext() (return true).
3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling next().

### 5.2 The For-Each Alternative to Iterators
- can't modify the contents of the collection
- can only be used to cycle through a collection in the forward direction

## 6. Spliterators
JDK 8 adds a new type of iterator called a spliterator that is defined by the **Spliterator** interface.
- more functionality than Iterator or ListIterator
    + provide support for parallel iteration of portions of the sequence
    + offers a streamlined approach 
- methods: characteristics, hasCharacteristics...

## 7. Storing User-Defined Classes in Collections

..an example in the book..

## 8. The RandomAccess Interface
- contains no members
- signals that it supports efficient random access to its elements
- e.g. implemented by ArrayList

## 9. Working with Maps
A map is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or key/value pairs.

- don't implement the Iterable interface

### 9.1 The Map Interfaces

##### 1. The Map Interface
- maps unique keys to values
- do not implement the Collection interface
- methods: get, put, entrySet, keySet...

##### 2. The SortedMap Interface
- extends Map
- entries are maintained in ascending order based on the keys
- methods: headMap, tailMap, subMap

##### 3. The NavigableMap Interface
- extends SortedMap

##### 4. The Map.Entry Interface
- enables to work with a map entry
- ```interface Map.Entry<K, V>```
- methods: getKay, getValue

### 9.2 The Map Classes
AbstractMap is a superclass for all concrete map implementations

##### 1. The HashMap Class
- extends AbstractMap
- implements the Map interface

##### 2. The TreeMap Class
- extends AbstractMap
- implements the NavigableMap interface
- store in a tree structure. key/value pairs in sorted order 

##### 3. The LinkedHashMap Class
- extends HashMap

##### 4. The IdentityHashMap Class
- extends abstractMap
- implements the Map interface
- similar to HashMap except that it uses reference equality when comparing elements

##### 5. The EnumMap Class
- extends AbstractMap
- implements Map
- use with keys of an enum type

## 10. Comparators

- the comparator defines precisely what "sorted order" means
- used by TreeSet and TreeMap
- methods prior to JDK 8
    + int compare(T obj1, T ohj2)
    + boolean equals(Object obj)
- methods (default and static) added by JDK 8
    + ```default Comparator<T> reversed()```
    + ```static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> Comparator<T> reverseOrder()```
    + ```static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> Comparator<T> naturalOrder()```
    + nullsFirst()
    + nullsLast()
    + ```default Comparator<T> thenComparing(Comparator<? super T> thenByComp)```
    + comparing()

### 10.1 Using a Comparator

...more details with example in the book...

## 11. The Collection Algorithms

- The Collections Framework dfines several algorithms that can be applied to collections and maps
- These algorithms are defined as static methods within the Collection class.
- e.g. Collections.reverseOrder()
- e.g. Collections.sort(collection, comp)
- e.g. Collections.shuffle(coll)

## 12. Arrays

- the Arrays class provides various methods that are useful when working with arrays
- e.g. asList(), binarySearch, copyOf, copyOfRange, equals, fill, sort

## 13. The Legacy Classes and Interface

### 13.1 The Enumeration Interface

### 13.2 Vector

### 13.3 Stack

### 13.4 Dictionary

### 13.5 Hashtable

### 13.6 Properties

### 13.7 Using store() and load()
